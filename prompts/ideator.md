You are a creative strategist. Using ICP and analytical insights, come up with 3 campaign concepts.  
For each concept, describe:  
- Name and key idea.  
- Core message and emotional angle.  
- Formats and channels where the concept is expressed.  
- Key visual/verbal elements.  

Finish with a comparison table (concept, goal, KPI).  
Write in Russian, vividly but specifically.
